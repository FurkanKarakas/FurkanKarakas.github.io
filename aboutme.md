subtitle: Let me tell you about myself
---

Hi, my name is Furkan KarakaÅŸ. I am a master's student in the department of computer and communication sciences at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, or EPFL for short ðŸ˜Š

## Areas that I am interested in

I have a strong interest in the following topics:

- cryptography and security,

- distributed systems,

- Blockchain networks,

- computer networks, TCP/IP networking.

On top of that, I like learning new stuff in the **HUGE** world of information technology by reading posts online. Furthermore, I have a
special interest in mathematics, especially in number theory. I like reading mathematical proofs, and, if not successful every time, trying
to prove "simple" mathematical statements ðŸ˜Š

## What my goal is

My goal is to become a life-long learner in the IT world by constantly refreshing myself and, as a result, to become successful in the work
that I will be doing.

## Previous education

I graduated from BoÄŸaziÃ§i University in Istanbul, Turkey with a double degree in mathematics and electrical engineering.
